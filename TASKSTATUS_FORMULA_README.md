# TASKSTATUS Formula Implementation

## Overview
The TASKSTATUS formula allows you to display task statuses directly in Univer spreadsheets and make them clickable for navigation. This implementation uses smart workbook-based processing that integrates seamlessly with Univer's data management system.

## Formula Syntax
```
=TASKSTATUS(taskId)
```

Where `taskId` is the numeric ID of the task you want to display.

## Implementation Details

### Smart Workbook-Based Processing
- Processes formulas by analyzing the actual workbook data structure
- Uses Univer's command system to update cells when possible
- Falls back to direct data updates for maximum compatibility
- Automatically detects new formulas as you type them
- Runs enhanced change tracking to trigger immediate processing

### Features
- **Automatic Status Display**: Converts `=TASKSTATUS(123)` to human-readable status
- **Click Navigation**: Click on any task status cell to navigate to the task detail page
- **Real-time Updates**: Formulas are processed within 10 seconds of being entered
- **Error Handling**: Shows helpful error messages for invalid task IDs
- **Workspace Isolation**: Only shows tasks from the current workspace

### Status Mapping
- `not_started` ‚Üí "Not Started"
- `in_progress` ‚Üí "In Progress"
- `completed` ‚Üí "Completed"
- `awaiting_external` ‚Üí "Awaiting External"
- `awaiting_internal` ‚Üí "Awaiting Internal"

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Basic Formula Test
1. Open any spreadsheet in the Portfolio Manager
2. Click on an empty cell (e.g., A1)
3. Type: `=TASKSTATUS(123)` (replace 123 with an actual task ID from your workspace)
4. Press Enter
5. Wait up to 10 seconds - the formula should automatically convert to the task status
6. If the task doesn't exist, you should see "#ERROR: Task not found"

### 2. Click Navigation Test
1. After a TASKSTATUS formula has been processed and shows a status
2. Click directly on the cell containing the status
3. You should be redirected to the task detail page
4. Check that the URL is in the format: `/single-workspace/{matterId}/tasks/{taskId}`

### 3. Multiple Tasks Test
1. Enter several TASKSTATUS formulas in different cells:
   - A1: `=TASKSTATUS(123)`
   - A2: `=TASKSTATUS(456)`
   - A3: `=TASKSTATUS(789)`
2. All formulas should be processed automatically
3. Each should display its respective task status
4. Clicking each cell should navigate to the correct task

### 4. Error Handling Test
1. Enter an invalid task ID: `=TASKSTATUS(999999)`
2. Should display: "#ERROR: Task not found"
3. Enter an invalid format: `=TASKSTATUS(abc)`
4. Should display: "#ERROR: Invalid task ID" or similar

### 5. Real-time Processing Test
1. Type a TASKSTATUS formula and immediately observe the console
2. You should see logs like:
   ```
   üìã Found TASKSTATUS formula at [0, 0]: =TASKSTATUS(123)
   üîç Fetching task 123 from database...
   ‚úÖ Updated cell [0, 0] with: In Progress
   ```

## Console Monitoring

Open your browser's developer console to monitor the formula processing:

### Expected Console Messages
```
üìã TASKSTATUS Formula Usage (Smart Implementation):
   1. Enter "=TASKSTATUS(123)" in any cell (replace 123 with actual task ID)
   2. Smart processor will convert it to task status automatically
   3. Regular Excel formulas work with Univer's engine
   4. Click on task status cells to navigate to task detail pages
   5. Processing uses workbook data for accurate cell targeting

### Processing Messages
```

```

### Navigation Messages
```
üîó Navigating to task 123 in matter 456
```

## Troubleshooting

### Formula Not Processing
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify the task ID exists in your current workspace
3. Ensure the formula syntax is correct: `=TASKSTATUS(number)`
4. Wait up to 10 seconds for processing
5. Try refreshing the page if formulas aren't detected

### Click Navigation Not Working
1. Ensure the formula has been processed (shows task status, not formula)
2. Click directly on the cell text, not empty areas
3. Check that you're in the correct workspace
4. Verify the task belongs to the current workspace

### Performance Issues
1. Smart processing runs every 10 seconds automatically
2. Change detection triggers immediate processing when you edit cells
3. Large numbers of formulas may take longer to process
4. Check console for processing completion messages

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Processing Pipeline
1. **Change Detection**: Listens for cell edit commands via Univer's command service
2. **Workbook Analysis**: Scans actual workbook data for TASKSTATUS formulas
3. **Task Resolution**: Fetches task data from cache first, then database
4. **Cell Updates**: Uses Univer's SetRangeValuesCommand or direct data updates
5. **Click Handling**: Stores cell coordinates and task info for navigation

### Error Resilience
- Multiple fallback methods for accessing Univer services
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic cleanup on component unmount

### Performance Optimizations
- Task data caching to reduce database queries
- Debounced processing to avoid excessive API calls
- Efficient workbook data scanning
- Smart interval management (10-second cycles)

## Integration Notes

This implementation:
- ‚úÖ Works alongside regular Excel formulas
- ‚úÖ Preserves all Univer functionality
- ‚úÖ Handles multiple spreadsheets per workspace
- ‚úÖ Maintains data integrity and formatting
- ‚úÖ Provides visual feedback and error messages
- ‚úÖ Includes comprehensive cleanup and error handling

The TASKSTATUS formula is processed independently of Univer's formula engine to avoid compatibility issues while maintaining full spreadsheet functionality.
